Running Instructions
Step 1: Compile and Run the C Program
1.	Compile the C Program:
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing WildlifeMonitoringForestFirePrevention.c. Compile the program using:

gcc WildlifeMonitoringForestFirePrevention.c -o wildlife_monitoring
2.	Run the C Program:
Execute the compiled program:

./wildlife_monitoring
This will start a simulation that writes sensor data to a file named sensor_data.txt.
Step 2: Run the Python Simulation Script
1.	Run the Python Script:
Open another terminal window and navigate to the same directory. Run the Python script using:
python simulation.py
This script will read data from sensor_data.txt and display a real-time plot of animal movements and fire locations.
Expected Output
•	The C program will print simulation steps, fire detections, and animal movements to the console.
•	The Python script will display a graphical interface showing the positions of animals (blue dots) and fires (red crosses) on a grid.
Troubleshooting Tips
•	Ensure that both the C program and Python script are running simultaneously to see real-time updates in the plot.
•	If the Python script does not update, check if the sensor_data.txt file is being updated by the C program.
•	Adjust the simulation duration or grid size in the C program as needed.
By following these instructions, you should be able to run a simulation of the Wildlife and Fire Monitoring System using the provided code files.
